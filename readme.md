# Pair Programming Session: Creating a simple Task Tracker

Create a basic Task Tracker app using React Native that allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

## Acceptance Criteria

Our app should have the following screens:

- **Task List Screen:**
  - Display a list of tasks with their titles.
  - Each task should have a checkbox to mark it as completed.
  - Include a button to add a task.
  - Bonus: Include a button to delete a task.

- **Add Task Screen:**
  - Create a modal screen to add a new task.
  - Include an input field for the task title.
  - Add a button to submit the new task.

### Styling:

Implement a simple and clean UI using React Native styling.

### Constraints:

- Use functional components and hooks.
- State management can be done using a global module/singleton/etc.
- You can use Expo Router (already configured) for navigation between screens.
- No need for persistent storage (local storage or database). Just keep the data in the app state.
- Focus on functionality over advanced styling.

## Running instructions

Install required dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Start the application:
```
npm run web
```
